startup-
disable all relays, 
check voltages (display them) 
if above 255 /<130 &>30 display triangle in front of faulty one and sound buzzer  
if button pressed for 3 seconds bypass fault mode(disable buzzer and allow connection to that output)
check if in auto or manual mode   


 If auto mode==true{
check voltages
 if master==normal && gen==on
Turn off gen relay
Send off command to gen

If master==off & gen =off & inv==off
Atmega 328 sends “gen on” over serial to the esp8266
The esp8266 connect to the prenamed wifi and, 
Send “gen on” to client to turn on generator, 
Wait for 30 seconds to repeat.


If more than 5 retries stop

If master==off & gen =off & inv==on
Use inverter

 if master==normal
Turn on master relay
Turn off others

 if master==normal && inv=on
Turn off inv rel turn on master
If inv==on }








Master - 0, gen - 0, inv - 0 (Turn on gen)
Master - 1, gen - 1, inv - 1 (Turn off gen, Switch to Master, Turn off Inv)

Master - 1, gen - 0, inv - 0 ( Switch to Master)
Master - 1, gen - 1, inv - 0 ( Switch to Master, Turn of gen)

Master - 0, gen - 1, inv - 0 (Turn off Master, Switch to Gen, Turn off Inv )
Master - 1, gen - 1, inv - 0 (Turn off gen, Switch to Master, Turn off Inv)

Master - 0, gen - 0, inv - 1 (Turn off gen, Turn off Master, Turn on Inv)
Master - 0, gen - 1, inv - 1 (Turn off gen, Turn off Master, Turn on Inv)


Manual mode

On master by default
Store current mode in eeprom

If relay toggle (changeover button) button ==low for 3 seconds, 
Display current mode count to 10
If relay toggle button (changeover button) ==low
Display next mode  reset count variable and count to 10
If relay toggle button (changeover button) == low
Display next mode , reset count variable count to 10
If count>10 choose current mode



Display (Current voltage source takes majority of the screen)

Display mode
Display current
Display the current voltage source
Display voltages of the 3 inputs
Display battery voltage











Generator board

Turns on checks the presence of ac 
Connect to wifi

Fnxn gen startup
Make servo turn choke, turn on first stage relay, 
Turn on the 2nd stage relay for 3 seconds.
Wait for 10 seconds 
Turn off choke
Check for ac
If ac==false, turn off relay1 and repeat
If ac ==true, leave stage 1 relay on

Fnxn gen off
Turn off stage 1 relay

If manual button is pressed and held for 3 seconds
 Check ac presence
If ac==false
Run gen startup protocol once


If ac==true
Turn off generator


If “gen on” received over wifi, 
run genstartup fnxn with 5 retries
If fails send “failed” to changeover

If bat<2.8 turn on  the power relay
Send “low battery over wifi
Else power relay==off
